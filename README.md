# OAK-JS-SDK
This library was developed by [OAK Foundation](https://oak.tech) for the purposes of having easier access to the Neumann and Turing blockchain extrinsics. 
This library was built on top of the [polkadot-js/api library](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) and wraps the polkadot JS APIs with more utility that may help with accessing our chain and using our APIs in more intuitive ways.
